# Ascent 🚀

Turn your self-improvement into a measurable, gamified adventure.

Ascent is a web application that helps you visualize your personal growth. It transforms habits, learning, and personal goals into a game, allowing you to track your progress, build consistent streaks, and earn XP for your efforts.



---

## 🎯 Features: Level Up Your Life

Ascent is built around a core loop of setting, tracking, and completing goals.

* **✨ Gamified XP System:** Every goal you create can be assigned an XP (Experience Point) value. Completing the goal banks that XP, contributing to your overall level. Watch your "level" rise as you stick to your commitments.

* **🏆 Goal & Habit Tracking:** Create detailed goals with deadlines, categories (e.g., "Fitness," "Learning," "Productivity"), and descriptions. You can also set up recurring daily or weekly habits.

* **🔥 Automatic Streak Counter:** Consistency is key. Ascent automatically tracks your daily "streaks" for completing tasks, providing a powerful visual motivator (🔥 10 days!) to keep you going.

* **📊 Dynamic Progress Dashboard:** Your personal dashboard is your mission control. It features charts to visualize your XP earned over time, your goal completion rate, and your longest streaks, all powered by your real-time data.

* **🔒 Secure & Private:** Built with `NextAuth.js` and a serverless backend, your data is your own. Sign in quickly with social providers (like Google or GitHub) and trust that your goals and progress are stored securely.

### 🏛️ Architecture

This project uses a modern full-stack architecture:

1.  **Frontend (Vercel):** The Next.js application is hosted on Vercel.
2.  **Authentication (Vercel):** `NextAuth.js` runs on Vercel, managing user sessions.
3.  **Backend (Vercel):** Secure **Next.js API Routes** act as the backend. They check the user's session, validate input with `Zod`, and use Prisma to communicate with PostgreSQL.
4.  **Database:** `PostgreSQL` acts as the persistent data layer, accessed via Prisma ORM.
